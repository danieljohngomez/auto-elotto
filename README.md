<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Wouldn't it be nice to have an automated betting for Philippines' eLotto system (PCSO)? This project allows you to bet with low-effort without the hassle of logging in, selecting numbers, and paying for the bet.
You can set up the app to run everyday at a specific time to bet on your behalf. Get notified when a bet is successful and when you need to top up your balance. Soon, you'll get notified as well when you win!

The app will pick the game with the highest winning prize. Currently only 6/58 and 6/55 are supported.

> [!WARNING]  
> Please gamble responsibly. Only bet what you can afford to lose.
